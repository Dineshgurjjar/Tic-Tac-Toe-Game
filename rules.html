            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board.</p>

            <h2>Game Setup</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Board:</strong> Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Optionally, it can also be played on larger grids like 4x4 or 5x5.</li>
                <li><strong>Players:</strong> The game is played between two players, typically represented by X and O.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Turns:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player X always goes first.</li>
                        <li>Players take turns marking empty cells on the board with their respective symbols (X or O).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning Condition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A player wins by getting three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.</li>
                        <li>If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has achieved a winning condition, the game is a draw.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Game Flow:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player X starts the game.</li>
                        <li>Players continue alternating turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game can be played with a paper and pencil, or digitally as in this case.</li>
                <li>Strategies involve trying to create a winning line while blocking the opponent from doing so.</li>
                <li>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game that helps develop basic pattern recognition and strategic thinking skills.</li>
